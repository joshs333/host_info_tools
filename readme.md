# Host Info Tools
A small toolset for automatic host detection with multicast.

## Install
Pip will install all the base files and modules, then `hit` installs and sets up the service file.
```
sudo -H pip3 install .
sudo hit enable
```

# Configuration
Once installed modify /etc/host_info_tools/host_info_server.yaml to modify behavior.
